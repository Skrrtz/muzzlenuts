        <div>Coding has been my journey for over seven years now, and it's been an exhilarating ride. I've had the opportunity to explore and work with several programming languages, including C++, C#, JavaScript, Lua, and I've even dabbled in social engineering, which adds a fascinating dimension to my skill set. </div>
        <div>But what really sets my heart racing is the world of cybersecurity. It's a constantly evolving realm that demands creativity, problem-solving, and a commitment to staying one step ahead of cyber threats. Currently, I'm immersed in the intriguing field of reverse engineering, a skill that's indispensable for understanding the intricacies of software and systems.</div>
